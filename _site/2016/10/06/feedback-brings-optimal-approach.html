<p><span style="color:#0564be">So what makes thoughtworker work better? </span></p>

<p>Let me tell you a story of my team.
My current project is a UI-heavy application with fancy layout, lively animation and perfect user experience.</p>

<p>One day, our designer gave us responsive mockup for one feature.</p>

<p><span style="color:#0564be">Mobile:</span></p>

<p>Selection area has two lines. The left type dropdown has fixed width, the right input box need to be self-adaptive which cover the rest of the space.
Then one GO button follows.</p>

<p><img src="/asset/images/design-for-mobile.png" width="240px" alt="Mobile Design" /></p>

<p><span style="color:#0564be">Tablet:</span></p>

<p>Selection area becomes one line, the left type dropdown and the right GO button has fixed width, the middle input box need to be self-adaptive.</p>

<p><img src="/asset/images/design-for-tablet.png" width="400px" alt="Tablet Design" /></p>

<p><span style="color:#0564be">Desktop:</span></p>

<p>Similar with tablet, just consider the line has max-width.</p>

<p><img src="/asset/images/design-for-desktop.png" width="700px" alt="Desktop Design" /></p>

<p>Look pretty simple, right?</p>

<p>In fact, it takes <strong>FOUR TIMES</strong> more time than everyone imagine.</p>

<p>The first and regular solution that comes into mind is <code class="highlighter-rouge">position: absolute, left: $fixed-width, ...</code>
During code review, everyone think <em>position</em> is such a jack of all trades, should not use unless no other ways. So we decide to rethink.</p>

<p>Pairing with sarah, she comes up with <code class="highlighter-rouge">display:table-cell, min-width: $fixed-width, max-width:$fixed-width, ...</code>
This solves the two column (one is fixed, the other is self-adaptive) requirement for mobile version.
But still kind of tricky, need to set <em>min-width and max-width</em> to limit width. Also very hard to implement the tablet/desktop version.
So we overthrow current approach. Rethink again.</p>

<p>I suggest to use common two column pattern with <code class="highlighter-rouge">float:left, float:right, margin-left: $fixed-width, ...</code> for mobile,
adding <code class="highlighter-rouge">margin-right:$fixed-width, margin-top: -$height</code> for tablet/desktop.</p>

<p>Our premier photographer - Fang says: Why not using New layout mode - <em>flex</em> ? Quick win using <code class="highlighter-rouge">display:flex, align-content: space-around, ...</code>
Unfortunately, flex’s good friends <code class="highlighter-rouge">align-items: center, justify-content: center</code> is not that compatible with iPhone 4 and safari 7.</p>

<p>In the end, using <code class="highlighter-rouge">float</code> is the final conclusion.</p>

<p>When you read here, I double the following words, you know exactly what I am feeling and what thoughtworker does everyday.</p>

<h4 id="what-i-learn-from-this">What I learn from this:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Listen other’s feedback and take action</li>
  <li>Treat every approach as good as it gets.</li>
  <li>Think twice when using regular way!</li>
  <li>Never stop trying new things.
<small style="color: #0564be">Maybe its adaptability and compatibility is not that good. Still worth trying, at least learn something new.</small></li>
</ul>
